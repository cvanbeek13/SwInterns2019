# Answers to Additional Questions

The following are my answers to your additional questions:

## I say "Agile", you think...

Continuous improvement and limiting errors:  By working on small sections of code for a short period of time, little issues are handled before they become major issues.

## I say "DevOps", you think...

Quick Delivery: Getting products to customers quickly so the entire development team can get feedback and adjust.  This allows companies to pivot to the needs of customers as fast as possible.  There are many available software platforms to assist with DevOps.

## I say "C++", you think...

Object-Oriented C:  Although I haven't had much experience with C++, I have done numerous projects in Java, C#, and C, so I could pick it up easily.

## I say "Internship", you think...

A company taking an employee for a test drive.  You get to see if I am a good fit for a long term position.  Meanwhile, I gain valuable experience and determine if I like the role I have at that company. 

## What are some programming pet peeves you have?

In a previous co-op I received a partially completed Java application.  Initially, the developer had added comments to their code, but then they went back and changed their implimentation.  They kept the original comments though, which were then incorrect.  It took me a bit of time to notice that the comments were incorrect.

## Tell us about the people who've influenced your programming.

Michael Krajnak was the software architect for the project I was working on last year at GE Healthcare. He challenged me to use my programming skills to find new and creative ways to verify new products. 

## Tell us why you think you'd make an awesome addition to our team.

In addition to having experience programming at a past co-op, I offer one additional benefit most applicants won't have.  Since I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering, I have used SolidWorks extensivly in my engineering work.  I'm working on my fourth semester long project with SolidWorks based design. I've come to enjoy using SolidWorks, and by joining your team, you would gain a member who is already passionate about the product.
